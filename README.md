# WikiDeJogos

WikiDeJogos is (or will be eventually) a collab effort similar to the wikipedia format, where people can add game recommendations. It is inspired by the /v/'s Recommendation Wiki, which is mostly abandoned.

Since it's also my first actual project, it will evolve along my skills, but the idea is to develop it mainly in javascript.

The anime girl is actually the os-tan from Windows XP.
